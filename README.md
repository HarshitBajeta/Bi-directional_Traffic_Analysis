# Bi-directional_Traffic_Analysis


The bidirectional vehicle counting project aims to accurately count vehicles entering and exiting a specific area using the YOLOv8 object detection model and the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm. The project involves capturing video frames, applying the YOLOv8 model for vehicle detection, tracking the vehicles using SORT, and determining their direction of movement. Virtual lines are drawn to separate northbound and southbound directions, and vehicles crossing these lines are counted accordingly. Post-processing techniques such as non-maximum suppression and occlusion handling are employed to improve accuracy. The project focuses on fine-tuning hyperparameters, implementing advanced tracking algorithms, and continuously improving the model based on feedback and evaluation. The ultimate goal is to achieve a reliable and efficient vehicle counting system for real-world applications.
